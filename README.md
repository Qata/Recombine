# Recombine

Recombine is a [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)-like implementation of the unidirectional data flow architecture in Swift.

# About Recombine

Recombine relies on three principles:
- **The Store** stores your entire app state in the form of a single data structure. This state can only be modified by dispatching Actions to the store. Whenever the state in the store changes, the store will notify all observers.
- **Actions** are a declarative way of describing a state change. Actions don't contain any code, they are consumed by the store and forwarded to reducers. Reducers will handle the actions by implementing a different state change for each action.
- **Reducers** provide pure functions that create a new app state from actions and the current app state.

For a very simple app, one that maintains a counter that can be increased and decreased, you can define the app state as following:

```swift
struct AppState {
  let counter: Int
}
```

You would also define two actions, one for increasing and one for decreasing the counter. For the simple actions in this example we can use a very basic enum:

```swift
// It's recommended that you use enums for your actions to ensure a well typed implementation.
enum AppAction: Action {
    case modify(Modification)
    
    enum Modification {
        case increase
        case decrease
    }
}
```

Your reducer needs to respond to these different actions, that can be done by switching over the value of action:

```swift
// I recommend using a tool to enable lensing like Sourcery when working with a state with more than a handful of elements.
let appReducer: Reducer<AppState> { state, action in
    switch action {
    case .modify(.increase):
        // Please let us implicitly return from switches we beg of you core team.
        return .init(counter: state.counter + 1)
    case .modify(.decrease):
        return .init(counter: state.counter - 1)
    }
}
```
